# Face Detection


In this project, I will use OpenCV library in Python to apply face detection in stream using webcam.
<br>

# Working Method

First, I installed OpenCV library.
Then, I downloaded haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file and put it in the same folder with my python file.
Finally, running camera-detection.py file will detect my face and draw a rectangular around it.
